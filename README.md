The Resolve-Ables project is a collection of wearable devices that enable visualization of phenomena we can’t detect with our biological senses. In our environments, we are surrounded by fields and waves that we can’t observe or interact with. This project sets out to design tools that can create artistic representations of phenomena through different, sensing, visual, and photographic techniques.
