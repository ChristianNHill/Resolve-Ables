This repo contains all the photos taken for the Resolve-Ables project.

The Resolve-Ables project is a collection of wearable devices that enable visualization of phenomena we canâ€™t see with our biological senses. In our environments, we are surrounded by fields and waves that we canâ€™t observe or interact with. This project sets out to design tools that can create artistic representations of phenomena through different, sensing, visual, and photographic techniques.
